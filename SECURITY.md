## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues privately via GitHub Security Advisories.
Navigate to the Security tab in this repository and choose "Report a
vulnerability." Do not open a public issue for security reports.

We will acknowledge reports within 3 business days and provide updates as we
make progress. If the report is accepted, we will work on a fix and coordinate
disclosure. If the report is declined, we will explain the reasoning.
